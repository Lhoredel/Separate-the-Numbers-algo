# Separate-the-Numbers-algo
This program answers the Separate the Numbers problem by determining whether a string can be divided into a series of consecutive rising integers. It tries all potential starting number lengths, builds the sequence by incrementing from each candidate, and checks against the original string. The procedure verifies validity if the rebuilt sequence matches exactly, else concludes the string cannot be divided into such a sequence.
